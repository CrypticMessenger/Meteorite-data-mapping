- [x] User Story 1: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
- [x] User Story 2: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
- [x] User Story 3: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Tools/Libraries Used:
- Leaflet.js
- jQuery
- particles.js (just for experimenting basis, not neccesary )
